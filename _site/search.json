You will download the data, clean it as needed, learn its ins and outs, and produce some compelling visuals. You will then present on the dataset to the class for ~ 10 minutes. Points to hit in the presentation:\n\nWhat does an observation look like in this data? What is being measured? How do the authors get from raw text to the final product? (~ 1 slide)\nYou will create and discuss two interesting visualizations from this dataset; could be time series, bivariate relationship, conditional means, a table, etc. (2 slides)\nStrengths and weaknesses – what is good and exciting about this project? What kinds of questions could we answer with this data? What are the limitations (temporal, spatial, conceptual)? (~ 1-2 slides)\n\nSee Data sets for a list of ideas. Below are also some good templates for making interesting visualizations of datasets:\n\nAnalysis of the bible\nAnalysis of baby names\nSpeed dating experiment\n\n\n\nSubmission\nYou will work in pairs and submit jointly (sign up sheet in class). Two outputs: an R script with the code used to make visuals/tables + the presentation. Each pair of students will email me these shortly after their presentation."
