# Course description


This course is a graduate-level introduction to the field of international relations (IR), focusing on core theoretical and empirical debates in the literature. Readings are a mix of old and new, leaning towards newer work.  


The primary goal of this course is to for students to develop a sense for where the literature has been and where it is going. As students move forward with their studies, this course will help students develop a fuller sense of the context in which other work they read is situated.


# Course policies


Late proposals, papers, etc. will be penalized by a letter grade per day, up to two days, then it's a zero. 


# Assignments



## Participation (5% of grade)


To receive full credit you must: 

1) come to class having read

2) be engaged in discussion



## Discussion questions (DQs; 10% of grade)


Eeach week you will post one bullet point discussion question/comment *per reading* to Canvas. The questions/comments need to be **good**. A good discussion question offers a *specific* critique, is thought-provoking, generates discussion among the group, etc. A not-good discussion question is above all *generic* -- it is not specific to the reading and leaves the group without guidance on where to take the discussion. 

<!-- Here's some common, not-good discussion questions/comments: -->

<!-- > The paper only has data going back to T and not T-1, so I don't believe it though I can't explain why. -->

<!-- > The author says their theory assumes X, but assumptions are bad though I won't say why. -->

<!-- > The paper is about X, but not Y, the thing I'm interested in. What about Y? -->




⭐ Due dates: Sunday by midnight before each class



## Peer-review (30% of grade)


You will write two mock "peer-reviews" in the spirit of working as a reviewer for a journal. Your review should eschew summary in favor of critically evaluating the paper ([a great guide here](http://macartan.nyc/teaching/how-to-critique/)). The goal is to make a recommendation to an editor (me) as to whether or not the paper should be published. If your recommendation is to "revise and resubmit" assume that implies a high probability of publication. *The review should be between 500 and 800 words in length.* 

Due dates: 

* Review 1 due by February 3rd, 2023 ⭐
* Review 2 due by March 3rd, 2023 ⭐


Choose two from the following:

- [The Dirty-Work Hypothesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xpbdqc02y45bcf3/dreher_etal.pdf?dl=0)

- [Perspective Taking and Security Dilemma Thinking: Experimental Evidence from China and the United States](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fek66jd14dynmr/SCS%20Manuscript%20082222%20Public.pdf?dl=0)

- [The Impact of China’s AIIB on the World Bank](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ft9eiegoe7r7y2/Qian_Vreeland_Zhao_IO.pdf?dl=0)


- [Losing on the Home Front? Battlefield Casualties, Media, and Public Support for Foreign Interventions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xgo5neo0tamutrg/manuscript_appendix%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0)

- [Why Rich Countries Win Investment  Disputes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6bzzwaxu473r0zq/why_rich_countries_win_investment_disputes.pdf?dl=0)



## Dataset presentation (25% of grade)


### Instructions

The goal of this assignment is to become acquainted with an important data collection effort in our field. You will download the data, clean it as needed, learn its ins and outs, and produce some compelling visuals. You will then present on the dataset to the class for ~ 10 minutes. Points to hit in the presentation: 

- What does an *observation* look like in this data? What is being measured? How do the authors get from raw text to the final product? (*~ 1 slide*)
- You will create and discuss **two** *interesting* visualizations from this dataset; could be time series, bivariate relationship, conditional means, a table, etc. (*2 slides*)
- Strengths and weaknesses -- what is good and exciting about this project? What kinds of questions could we answer with this data? What are the limitations (temporal, spatial, conceptual)? (*~ 1-2 slides*)


See [Data sets](#datasets) for a list of ideas. Below are also some good templates for making interesting visualizations of datasets:


- [Analysis of the bible](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/26/tidytext-pos-john/)
- [Analysis of baby names](https://rpubs.com/michalhron/babynames)
- [Speed dating experiment](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jennivine/the-ugly-truth-of-people-decisions-in-speed-dating)


### Submission


You will work in pairs and submit jointly (sign up sheet in class). Two outputs: an R script with the code used to make visuals/tables + the presentation. Each pair of students will email me these shortly after their presentation. 


## Research proposal (30%)


6 pages. See [the rubric](#rubric). You should meet with me to talk through your idea, sooner rather than later. 


⭐ Due by March 21, 2023.

## Final research design rubric {#rubric}


12 pages MAX, double-spaced.


1. Introduction (1 pages)
	1. Motivate why we should care about the question you want to answer (e.g., because of its real-world impact, as a gap in the literature)
	2. BRIEFLY preview what the project will do (I will argue that X) and how it will do it (I will collect XYZ data)
2. Literature review (2 pages)
	1. Briefly describe what we already know about your topic
	2. Highlight what is unknown or what gap your project will fill
3. Theory + hypotheses (3 pages)
	1. Big note: theory != literature review
	2. Need an argument about a causal process
	3. Think about who the actors are in your story, what they want, and how their interactions produce different outcomes
